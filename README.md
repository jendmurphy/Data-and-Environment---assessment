# Data and Environment - assessment

A collection of files, notebooks and workings for submission to Manchester University.  A good report in the end, but not my finest coding work!  There were a lot of shortcuts done in Excel and at the time I didn't know how to use the .predict() function so a lot of work was done very manually.  A good learning experience but a messy set of files unfortunately!
